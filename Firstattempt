Project Idea: Task Manager

Description:
Create a simple task manager application where users can create, update, delete, and view tasks. The application will consist of a RESTful API built with Flask and a web interface to interact with the API.

Features:

Task CRUD Operations:

Users can create tasks with a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
Users can view a list of all tasks.
Users can update task details or mark tasks as completed.
Users can delete tasks.
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using Flask-Login or JWT tokens to allow users to sign up, log in, and log out.
Ensure that only authenticated users can access the task management features.
Database Integration:

Use SQLite or another database of your choice to store task data.
Define a database model for tasks with appropriate fields.
Web Interface:

Create a web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the API endpoints.
Implement AJAX requests to perform CRUD operations without refreshing the page.
Display tasks in a user-friendly format, allowing users to easily view and manage their tasks.
Error Handling and Validation:

Implement error handling and validation to ensure that users provide valid input when creating or updating tasks.
Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
Optional Enhancements:

Add search and filter functionality to allow users to search for tasks by title, due date, or status.
Implement pagination for the task list to improve performance when displaying large numbers of tasks.
Allow users to prioritize tasks or assign tasks to different categories or projects.
Benefits:

This project will help you understand the basics of creating and consuming RESTful APIs using Flask.
You'll gain experience in building a web application with CRUD functionality and integrating it with a database.
By implementing user authentication, you'll learn how to secure your application and restrict access to certain features.
Developing a task manager can be useful for personal productivity or as a project management tool for small teams.
